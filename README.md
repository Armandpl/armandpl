### Hi there 👋

My name is Armand du Parc Locmaria. I love building. Whether that's [RL Robots 🤖](https://github.com/Armandpl/furuta), [autonomous RC racecars 🏎️](https://github.com/Armandpl/wandb-jetracer), [Minecraft cheat mods 😈](https://armandpl.com/projects/cng-mods) or [jewels 💍](https://armandpl.com/projects/jewelry-making.html).    
I am a soon to be Machine Learning Engineer. I am **currently available for a 6 months end of study internship** starting between March and June 2022. I study at [ECE Paris](https://www.ece.fr/ecole-ingenieur/).

Feel free to reach out at adpl33[at]gmail.com !
