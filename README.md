### Hi there 👋

My name is Armand, I can make things. Among those things are [RL Robots 🤖](https://github.com/Armandpl/furuta), [autonomous RC racecars 🏎️](https://github.com/Armandpl/wandb-jetracer), [Minecraft hacks 🥷](https://armandpl.com/projects/cng-mods) and [✨jewels✨](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phko7W1RhAA). I interned at [Weights&Biases🪄🐝](https://wandb.ai/site) then at [Loyal For Dogs🐶](https://loyalfordogs.com/) and studied at [ECE Paris](https://www.ece.fr/ecole-ingenieur/).
